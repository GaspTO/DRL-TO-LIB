THERE ARE SEVERAL DAGGERS WHICH ARE DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS

1º DAGGER_simple_follow_probs
	
	- simple mcts
	- no replay
	- cross entropy between mcts probabilities and network probabilities
	
	RESULTS: meh
	

2º DAGGER_simple_follow_action

	- simple mcts
	- no replay
	- cross entropy between mcts best action and network probabilities
	
	RESULTS: slow
	

3º DAGGER_REPLAY_follow_action

	- simple mcts
	- replay
	- cross entropy between mcts best action and network probabilities
	
	RESULTS: very good, way faster to achieve positive results
	

4º DAGGER_mcts_rl_Replay_follow_action 

	- mcts with node probabilities given by network
	- replay
	- cross entropy between mcts best action and network probabilities
	
	
5º DAGGER_GENERAL
	
	- has all the mcts strategies
	- replay
	- cross entropy between mcts best action and network probabilities

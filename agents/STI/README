STI stands for search tree iteration
The goal of this folder is to create an abstract algorithm like mcts
but in which you can easily change the different strategies, mainly
the search strategy.

So, instead the typical greedy dfs done by mcts in each iteration, you might have
something like A*

I put a NEW_DAGGER here, cause I don't want to disturb the TREE_Agents folder
since it's stable
